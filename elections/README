Run process-votes.py.

You should have a file votes.csv in the current directory. This is a
comma-separated value file exported from Google Forms's vote output.

The first row of votes.csv should include column headers with
candidate names in square brackets.

The second row, and all remaining rows of votes.csv, should be lists
of numbered priorities for each candidate. A candidate not ranked should
have a rank of an empty string.

This script produces board_nominations.ini and votedata.txt for use
with the Apache STeVe tabulation script.
